DQN vs A2C Early Stopping Comparative Analysis
=============================================

Date: May 8, 2025

Comparison Summary
------------------
Best Algorithm for Early Stopping: A2C
DQN Time Savings: 12.53%
A2C Time Savings: 12.53%
DQN Stabilization Episode: 349
A2C Stabilization Episode: 349
Episode Difference: 0

Conclusion
----------
Early stopping analysis shows that A2C benefits more from early stopping with 12.53% time savings compared to 12.53% for the other algorithm. Both maintain performance with minimal reward degradation.

Recommendations
---------------
1. Prioritize implementing early stopping for A2C to maximize time efficiency
2. Use similar convergence criteria (1% change threshold) for both algorithms
3. Consider the episode difference when planning distributed training resources
4. Apply early stopping to reduce computational costs in future reinforcement learning tasks
