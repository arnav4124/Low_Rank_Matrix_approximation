    "conclusion": "Early stopping analysis shows that A2C benefits more from early stopping with 12.53% time savings compared to 12.53% for the other algorithm. Both maintain performance with minimal reward degradation.",
    "recommendations": [
        "Prioritize implementing early stopping for A2C to maximize time efficiency",
        "Use similar convergence criteria (1% change threshold) for both algorithms",
        "Consider the episode difference when planning distributed training resources",
        "Apply early stopping to reduce computational costs in future reinforcement learning tasks"
