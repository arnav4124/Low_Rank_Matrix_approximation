DQN Early Stopping Analysis Report
==================================

Date: May 8, 2025

Summary
-------
Stabilization Point: Episode 349 of 399
Time Savings: 12.53%
Episodes Saved: 50
Reward Difference: -0.8023 (2.33%)

Conclusion
----------
Training can be stopped at episode 349 with minimal impact on performance, saving approximately 12.53% of training time.

Recommendations
---------------
1. Implement early stopping based on reward stabilization
2. Monitor the percentage change in reward and loss values
3. Consider a 1% change threshold as a stopping criterion
4. Set a window of 349 episodes as the baseline training duration
